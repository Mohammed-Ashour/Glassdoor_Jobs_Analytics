job description


the next great shift in consumer behavior driven by technological disruption is underway, and it’s happening in the food & beverage industry.

as other sectors have shifted to ecommerce-first business models in recent years, food & beverage has continued to rely predominantly on traditional brick & mortar models, but this is changing rapidly. new technologies are transforming every aspect of reaching consumers, from the rise of digital marketing and online grocery platforms to the creation of supply chain tools that enable speedy at-home delivery. according to the food marketing institute, 70% of u.s. consumers will shop online for groceries by 2024, with an estimated annual spend of $100 billion.

to deepen our efforts to seize this opportunity and lead the food & beverage industry into its remarkable next chapter, pepsico – a global company with powerhouse brands including frito-lay, gatorade, pepsi-cola, quaker, and tropicana – is expanding its global ecommerce team. we’re looking for the greatest minds in software engineering, data & analytics, machine learning and next-generation supply chain. given pepsico’s incredible reach (our foods and beverages are enjoyed more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories, leveraging a value chain involving diverse partners ranging from farmers and food scientists to retailers and logistics specialists), the challenges we’re addressing are complex and the solutions will be deeply impactful.

although pepsico is a large multinational, the pepsico global ecommerce team prides itself on having the entrepreneurial, action-oriented culture of an exciting startup business. our group includes startup founders, silicon valley veterans, food & beverage experts, and seasoned executives from digital transformation leaders such as amazon and walmart. our goal is to build the technological products and capabilities that will reinvent our industry and make us the #1 food & beverage business in ecommerce for decades to come.

we're looking for a full stack engineer to join our growing engineering team and assist us in driving product initiatives forward while upholding our high engineering standards.

you will own application development end-to-end, spanning data models, testing, scalability, operability, and ongoing metrics.
we work in elixir: however, languages can be learned. we put more emphasis on your general engineering skill and willingness to learn than knowledge of a particular language or framework.
we need you to be versatile, display leadership qualities, and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.
you will work directly with designers to implement and build fully-featured modern web applications.
some technologies that we use - we don't expect you to know all of these but some familiarity would be great:
functional programming e.g. elixir, clojure or haskell
ruby on rails
python
postgresql
qualifications/requirements
bachelor’s degree in computer science or related field
preferred qualifications:
experience defining system architectures and exploring technical feasibility tradeoffs
6+ years of professional experience in software development
3+ years of professional experience with html/css (sass) and javascript
knowledge of professional software engineering practices & best practices for the full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, continuous integrations, testing, and operations
hands-on experience with cloud-based platform capabilities
ability to transform a design into a working product
bonus qualifications:
experience with elixir and the phoenix web framework
extra bonus points if you’ve used phoenix liveview

(Glassdoor est.)","at hrt, we program computers to intelligently trade on the stock market. we make the world's markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. to get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform.

algo software engineers (ae) are programmers that are embedded in hrt's trading teams and work hand-in-hand with algo strategy developers (ad). whereas ads tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, aes focus on the software that powers trading and research. because of this close collaboration, aes tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. aes are the type of engineers that don't mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.

our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. for one, the company's partners are all programmers. team leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training.

we are a linux/unix shop with a codebase written primarily in c++ and python. if you are not a c++ or python or linux expert, that's probably ok. we really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. that being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as c++ or java.

here are a few examples of programmers who are currently aes at hrt:
when he's not solving riddles and dancing salsa, david's writing distributed computing apis. he regularly solves bugs like ""one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on tuesdays"". he likes bridging the gap between algo strategy developers and systems engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. he really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.
kai came to hrt after 3.5 years of programming c++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. he plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. he builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. he is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.
aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to hrt. he cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. he gets joy from his teammates' happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. he's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. he enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.
culture:
hudson river trading (hrt) brings a scientific approach to trading financial products. we have built one of the world's most sophisticated computing environments for research and development. our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the world of algorithmic trading.

at hrt we come from all sorts of backgrounds: mathematics, computer science, statistics, physics, and engineering. we're a community of self-starters who are motivated by the excitement of being at the cutting edge of automated trading. our culture celebrates great ideas whether they come from hrt veterans or new hires. at hrt we're friends and colleagues, whether we are sharing a meal, playing the latest board game, or writing elegant code. we embrace a culture of togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our office.

seem like something you might be interested in? our goal is to find the best people and bring them together to do great work in a place where everyone is valued. hrt is proud of our diverse staff; we have offices all over the globe and benefit from our varied and unique perspectives. hrt is an equal opportunity employer; so whoever you are we'd love to get to know you.",5.0,"Hudson River Trading

every year, while americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. as a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. we don't accept that.

earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. cash out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. with health aid, earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. cash back rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. we also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! there is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

earnin is supported by funding partners including andreessen horowitz, matrix partners, ribbit capital, felicis venture, thrive capital, and others. join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

(Glassdoor est.)","at hrt, we program computers to intelligently trade on the stock market. we make the world's markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. to get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform.

algo software engineers (ae) are programmers that are embedded in hrt's trading teams and work hand-in-hand with algo strategy developers (ad). whereas ads tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, aes focus on the software that powers trading and research. because of this close collaboration, aes tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. aes are the type of engineers that don't mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.

our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. for one, the company's partners are all programmers. team leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training.

we are a linux/unix shop with a codebase written primarily in c++ and python. if you are not a c++ or python or linux expert, that's probably ok. we really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. that being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as c++ or java.

here are a few examples of programmers who are currently aes at hrt:
when he's not solving riddles and dancing salsa, david's writing distributed computing apis. he regularly solves bugs like ""one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on tuesdays"". he likes bridging the gap between algo strategy developers and systems engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. he really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.
kai came to hrt after 3.5 years of programming c++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. he plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. he builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. he is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.
aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to hrt. he cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. he gets joy from his teammates' happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. he's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. he enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.
culture:
hudson river trading (hrt) brings a scientific approach to trading financial products. we have built one of the world's most sophisticated computing environments for research and development. our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the world of algorithmic trading.

at hrt we come from all sorts of backgrounds: mathematics, computer science, statistics, physics, and engineering. we're a community of self-starters who are motivated by the excitement of being at the cutting edge of automated trading. our culture celebrates great ideas whether they come from hrt veterans or new hires. at hrt we're friends and colleagues, whether we are sharing a meal, playing the latest board game, or writing elegant code. we embrace a culture of togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our office.

seem like something you might be interested in? our goal is to find the best people and bring them together to do great work in a place where everyone is valued. hrt is proud of our diverse staff; we have offices all over the globe and benefit from our varied and unique perspectives. hrt is an equal opportunity employer; so whoever you are we'd love to get to know you.",5.0,"Hudson River Trading
